Order of use:

1. BLAST query ref > query 
            -OR - also query the reverse

2. Parse BLAST output in XML format (parsexml.py) into pairs of ids

3. Parse pairs of ids into combined cluster file with combine_clusters.py
            -OR - run mutual_hits.py first and then combine_clusters.py on the output

4. Create cluster fastas from the combined list with parse_genomes.py
            -OR - parse_genomes_anon.py to omit the ORF ids

5. Run multiple alignment with KALIGN using the bash query on all files:
            for f in *.fasta; do kalign $f -t 1 -e 3 -s 60 -o ../aligned_anon/$f; done

6. Select 10 alignments for tree reconstruction and move to separate folder.

7. Run extend_aln.py on the folder to combine into meta sequence alignment

8. Perfrom tree reconstruction with belvu.
